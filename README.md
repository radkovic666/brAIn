Brain is your intelligent virtual assistant, designed to make finding answers simple and interactive. With Brain, you can easily record your questions using voice or text, and the app will send your query to the powerful OpenAI API. Whether you're curious about science, history, or need help with a problem, Brain quickly provides a detailed answer.

The app displays the response in an easy-to-read format, and with its built-in narration feature, Brain can read the answer aloud for hands-free convenience. While the app currently supports English and Bulgarian for menus, it can handle questions in any language when typed. If you prefer speaking your question, the app uses Google Speech Recognizer, supporting a wide range of spoken languages.

Brain is the perfect tool for anyone who values quick, accurate answers, and it's your go-to app for reliable knowledge on the go.
